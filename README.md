Aori is a high-performance orderbook protocol for high-frequency trading on-chain and facilitating OTC settlement. This repository provides a TypeScript SDK for interacting with the Aori API to help developers integrate and build on top of the protocol as easily as possible.

Other packages are available for more periphery use cases of Aori to help developers build trading strategies and applications faster.
